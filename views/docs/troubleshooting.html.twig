            <strong>Q:</strong> I followed the <a href="/docs/hello-world">Hello World!</a> tutorial and I got
            it
            to work in telnet but couldn't get it working in any of the browsers.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> <a href="/docs/hello-world#nextsteps">You missed a step</a>

            <strong>Q:</strong> I'm using App and I get 404's when I try to connect.
            <br><strong>A: </strong> Make sure the first parameter ($host) of App is the same hostname you use
            to connect in your JavaScript WebSocket connection.
            If you need to support multiple hosts the fourth parameter of App::route() lets you specify an
            alternative $host to the default in __construct.

            <strong>Q:</strong> I'm using App and I get 403's when I try to connect.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> This is actually a security feature!
            App, by default, enforces a same origin policy to prevent other websites from connecting to your
            server.
            Either make sure you're opening WebSocket connections in JavaScript from the same URL as your $host
            in App
            or to allow another Origin the third parameter of App::route() accepts an array of allowed origins.

            <strong>Q:</strong> I can connect locally but not remotely or when I run on my server.
            <br><strong>A:</strong> This is also another security feature!
            By default Ratchet binds to 127.0.0.1 which only allows connections from itself.
            The recommended approach is to put Ratchet behind a proxy and only that proxy (locally) will
            connect.
            <br>If you want to open Ratchet up (not behind a proxy) set the third parameter of App to '0.0.0.0'.

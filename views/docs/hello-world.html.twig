    <h2>Creating <em>Your</em> First Application</h2>

            Goal <small><a class="headerlink" href="#goal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></small>
        </h3>

        <p>
            The goal of this application is to write a simple Chat application.
            Chats in event-driven programming are the "Hello World!" of applications.
            The chat will accept all incoming messages and deliver that message to all other connections.
        </p>

        <h3>
            The Chat class <small><a class="headerlink" href="#chatclass" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></small>
        </h3>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong>
            This document assumes you are familiar with <a
                    href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md" target="_blank"
                    rel="external">PSR-0</a>
            and <a href="http://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Composer</a>. See <a href="/docs/install">Installation</a>
            if you're not yet familiar with this.
        </p>

        <p>We're going to hold everything in the <em>MyApp</em> namespace. Your composer file should look something like
            this:</p>

                <pre class="prettprint">{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-0": {
            "MyApp": "src"
        }
    },
    "require": {
        "cboden/ratchet": "0.3.*"
    }
}</pre>


        <p>
            We'll start off by creating a class. This class will be our chat "application".
            This basic application will listen for 4 events:

        <ul>
            <li><em>onOpen</em> - Called when a new client has Connected</li>
            <li><em>onMessage</em> - Called when a message is received by a <em>Connection</em></li>
            <li><em>onClose</em> - Called when a <em>Connection</em> is closed</li>
            <li><em>onError</em> - Called when an error occurs on a <em>Connection</em>
        </ul>

        <p>Given those triggers, our class will implement the <a href="/api/class-Ratchet.MessageComponentInterface.html">MessageComponentInterface</a>:
        </p>

                    <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
namespace MyApp;
use Ratchet\MessageComponentInterface;
use Ratchet\ConnectionInterface;

class Chat implements MessageComponentInterface {
    public function onOpen(ConnectionInterface $conn) {
    }

    public function onMessage(ConnectionInterface $from, $msg) {
    }

    public function onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn) {
    }

    public function onError(ConnectionInterface $conn, \Exception $e) {
    }
}</pre>

        <p>
            You'll notice, in addition from just implementing methods from the <em>MessageComponentInterface</em>, we've
            given our application a namespace and are accepting the <a href="/api/class-Ratchet.ConnectionInterface.html">ConnectionInterface</a>
            classes.
            This class, usually implemented by a <a href="/api/class-Ratchet.Server.IoConnection.html">Connection</a>
            instance, is a representation of a client's connection on the other side of the socket.
            On each of the four triggered events, the client <em>Connection</em> representation is passed.
            These objects are re-used, you will receive the same <em>Connection</em> sometimes.
        </p>

        <p>Save this as <em>/src/MyApp/Chat.php</em>. We'll come back to our Chat class soon.</p>

            Instantiation <small><a class="headerlink" href="#instantiation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></small>
        </h3>

        <p>
            Our <em>Chat</em> class will be our application logic.
            Next, we're going to piece together our shell script.
            This is the script/file we will call from the command line to launch our application.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
use Ratchet\Server\IoServer;
use MyApp\Chat;

    require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    $server = IoServer::factory(
        new Chat(),
        8080
    );

    $server->run();</pre>

        <p>
            Above, you'll see we create an I/O (Input/Output) server class.
            It stores all the established connections, mediates data sent between each client and our <em>Chat</em>
            application,
            and catches errors. The new instance of <em>Chat</em> class then wraps the I/O Server class.
            Finally, we tell the server to enter an event loop, listening for any incoming requests on port 8080.
        </p>

        <p>
            Save this script as <em>/bin/chat-server.php</em>.
            Now, we can run it with the following command in your terminal:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">$ php bin/chat-server.php</pre>

        <p>The script should now execute, taking possession of your terminal. You can cancel the script, as we're not quite
            finished yet.</p>

            Logic <small><a class="headerlink" href="#logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></small>
        </h3>

        <p>So far, we've just set up structure, both in our shell script and our <em>Chat</em> class. Now, to add code to
            our <em>Chat</em> to complete our application.</p>

        <p>
            Let's add some logic to our <em>Chat</em> class.
            What we're going to do, is track all incoming <em>Connections</em>, in order to send them messages.
            Typically, you would store a collection of items in an array, but we're going to use something called <a
                    rel="external" href="http://ca2.php.net/manual/en/class.splobjectstorage.php">SplObjectStorage</a>.
            These storage containers are built to store objects, which is what the incoming <em>Connections</em> are.
        </p>

            <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
namespace MyApp;
use Ratchet\MessageComponentInterface;
use Ratchet\ConnectionInterface;

class Chat implements MessageComponentInterface {
    protected $clients;

    public function __construct() {
        $this->clients = new \SplObjectStorage;
    }

    public function onOpen(ConnectionInterface $conn) {
        // Store the new connection to send messages to later
        $this->clients->attach($conn);

        echo "New connection! ({$conn->resourceId})\n";
    }

    public function onMessage(ConnectionInterface $from, $msg) {
        $numRecv = count($this->clients) - 1;
        echo sprintf('Connection %d sending message "%s" to %d other connection%s' . "\n"
            , $from->resourceId, $msg, $numRecv, $numRecv == 1 ? '' : 's');

        foreach ($this->clients as $client) {
            if ($from !== $client) {
                // The sender is not the receiver, send to each client connected
                $client->send($msg);
            }
        }
    }

    public function onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn) {
        // The connection is closed, remove it, as we can no longer send it messages
        $this->clients->detach($conn);

        echo "Connection {$conn->resourceId} has disconnected\n";
    }

    public function onError(ConnectionInterface $conn, \Exception $e) {
        echo "An error has occurred: {$e->getMessage()}\n";

        $conn->close();
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Complete, let's run it and test it. Open up three terminal windows, typing:</p>

        <pre>$ php bin/chat-server.php</pre>
        <pre>$ telnet localhost 8080</pre>
        <pre>$ telnet localhost 8080</pre>

        <p>In each of the telnet windows, type a message ("Hello World!") and see it appear in the other!</p>

        </h3>

        <p>
            Now that we have a basic working Chat application, let's make that work in a web browser (Chrome, FireFox, or
            Safari [for now]).
            First, let's go back to our <em>chat-server.php</em> script.
            We're going to utilize another component of Ratchet; the <em>WsServer</em> class:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
use Ratchet\Server\IoServer;
use Ratchet\Http\HttpServer;
use Ratchet\WebSocket\WsServer;
use MyApp\Chat;

    require dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

    $server = IoServer::factory(
        new HttpServer(
            new WsServer(
                new Chat()
            )
        ),
        8080
    );

    $server->run();
        </pre>

        <p>Run the shell script again, open a couple web browser windows, and open a javascript console or a page with the
            following javascript:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">var conn = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');
conn.onopen = function(e) {
    console.log("Connection established!");
};

conn.onmessage = function(e) {
    console.log(e.data);
};</pre>

        <p>Once you see the console message "Connection established!" you can start sending messages to other connected
            browsers:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
conn.send('Hello World!');</pre>

            This tutorial has been an introduction to help you get started with WebSockets and understand how Ratchet works.
            The next tutorial (in the works) will introduce the App class that will abstract some of the work into running
            your application.
